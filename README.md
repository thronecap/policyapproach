Scenario: A Regional Bank has been growing rapidly. In the past two years, it has acquired six smaller financial institutions. The long-term strategic plan is for the bank to keep growing and to “go public” within the next three to five years. FDIC regulators have told management that they will not approve any additional acquisitions until the bank strengthens its information security program. The regulators commented that the Regional Bank’s information security policy is confusing, lacking in structure, and filled with discrepancies. Your task is to analyze and fix the policy so the regional bank can continue its growth by acquisition strategy.
